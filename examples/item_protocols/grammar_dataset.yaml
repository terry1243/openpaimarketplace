  # Grammar check dataset

  This dataset is downloaded from [Building Educational Applications 2019 Shared Task: Grammatical Error Correction](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/).

  ## Dataset Introduction

  This dataset includes First Certificate in English (FCE) original corpus and a processed version which could be easily used by nlp models like fairseq.


  ## The file stucture

  ```
  .
  |-- processed_data
      |-- train.origin
      |-- train.correct
      |-- dev.origin
      |-- dev.correct
      |-- test.origin
      |-- test.correct
  |-- fce_v2.1.bea19
      |-- <raw data>
  ```

  The suffix ```.origin``` and ```.correct``` means original sentences and correct sentences seperately. The ```fce_v2.1.bea19``` is the raw data downloaded from websites.
