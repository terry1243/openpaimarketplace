  # Couplet Dataset

  This is the dataset of couplet.

  ## Data content

  This dataset contains processed data based on [Microsoft AI EDU project](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-edu/blob/master/B-%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5%E6%A1%88%E4%BE%8B/B13-AI%E5%AF%B9%E8%81%94%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E6%A1%88%E4%BE%8B/docs/fairseq.md).

  The original dataset was downloaded from [Public couplet dataset](https://github.com/wb14123/couplet-dataset) and was splited into ```test, train and valid``` with 98:1:1 proportion. The ```.up``` and ```.down``` files contains upper part and down part of a certain couplet seperately.

  ## The file stucture

  ```
  .
  |-- test.down // down part of couplet
  |-- test.up  // up part of couplet
  |-- train.down
  |-- train.up
  |-- valid.down
  |-- valid.up
  ```

  ## How to use it

  The data will be mounted at ```DATA_DIR``` environment variable. You could use ```$DATA_DIR``` in your command when submit jobs in pai.
